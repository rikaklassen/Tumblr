                    <p>Elon Musk announced Twitter will start <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.reuters.com/technology/twitter-remove-inactive-accounts-2023-05-08/">removing inactive or idle accounts</a>.<br/><br/>I have a dear friend who sometimes reply to their former partner, who has since passed away, and scrambling to back up all the tweets to Internet Archive and archive.today. That person was very important to them.<br/><br/>Except archive.today keeps timing out. Have most of the tweets archived, but about six months worth of dailys are still remaining.</p><p>Hoping to have everything archived before bestie panics. Their birthday is in three days and they don&rsquo;t need this kind of pressure at the moment.</p>
