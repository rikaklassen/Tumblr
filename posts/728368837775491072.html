He&rsquo;s now 11.<br/><br/>I miss him terribly.<br/><br/>Oh well. </p><p>Pavel&rsquo;s current co-owner cancelled the litter plan.</p><p>To be honest, it would be an awkward to ask anyway because bestie abhors hunting. We haven&rsquo;t talked yet about whether she detests recreational hunting, commercial hunting, subsistence hunting, wildlife conservation and all the nuance in between (bioethics and environmentalism in itself are also very diverse!) since animal liberation politics and abolitionist views on animal exploitation is multifaceted. </p><p>I do know bestie is an anti-capitalist and a vegan. But neither positions are indicative of someone&rsquo;s views since a previous partner is also a vegan for ecological reasons, and she directed her abolitionism at industrial agriculture, recreational entitlements and other systematic issues. <br/><br/>(For instance, commentary about moose-human conflicts would be centered around how moose benefits from timber plantation system and logging of old growth-forests to the detriment of other wildlife. Or how the root of human-wolf conflict is seeing the wolf as an adversary and a competitor and farmers&rsquo; or hunters&rsquo; refusal to accommodate and co-exist.).</p><p>Pavel was rehomed to a hunting home where he participates in an eradication program to remove the invasive raccoon-dog (<i>Nyctereutes procyonoides</i>) to preserve native wildlife (such as waterfowls, reptiles, amphibians etc). And the most efficient way of removing raccoon-dogs is using dogs. </p><p>(Ironically, raccoon-dogs were introduced to regions west of East Asia because of the economic blockades against the Soviet Union, in which only fur, gold, grains and other commodities were allowed to be exchanged with the anti-Communist bloc. But that&rsquo;s a post for another day.)</p><p>Hence the social awkwardness.</p><p>I would like to visit Pavel some day. Just need someone to assist with navigating the public transit and the airports. ðŸ˜Š</p></blockquote>
<p>Litter plan is back on, but still don&rsquo;t know how to break the ice and and ask questions about the nuanced views on abolitionism.<br/><br/>If you want to help pay for travels, please consider contributing <a href="https://www.phttps//www.paypal.me/bglamours">via PayPal</a>.</p>
