The challenge for the U.S. study was to find older children whose parents would agree to the study, who had otoferlin deafness and who did not have cochlear implants.  Aissam never had cochlear implants. He never had schooling in Morocco to help him develop communication skills. But three years ago, when he was 8, his father, Youssef Dam, a construction worker, got a job in Barcelona, Spain. For the first time, Aissam went to school, enrolling in a school for the deaf, where he learned Spanish Sign Language. Soon after, his family learned of the gene therapy trial." srcset="https://64.media.tumblr.com/a06d357d292f9b7322a5abeded29d744/3dd58c113f84f253-b3/s75x75_c1/4a0757782239cc3a87362ea95ab4670a081f4e97.png 75w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/a06d357d292f9b7322a5abeded29d744/3dd58c113f84f253-b3/s100x200/a2f7cfcffdc65f583e4234983d6075b20f31a8e7.png 100w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/a06d357d292f9b7322a5abeded29d744/3dd58c113f84f253-b3/s250x400/6e4c824fe293c27408d6e8ffa36f56d32ccdbba5.png 250w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/a06d357d292f9b7322a5abeded29d744/3dd58c113f84f253-b3/s400x600/05499b45aea952de6a29cb5d4eb4fe2becf0f9e4.png 400w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/a06d357d292f9b7322a5abeded29d744/3dd58c113f84f253-b3/s500x750/e4b8d5f9b2605b1d2db714ab5d255af271b9a4e7.png 500w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/a06d357d292f9b7322a5abeded29d744/3dd58c113f84f253-b3/s540x810/a2b84d0692286e1155111bf05d2ad430f9bdd614.png 540w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/a06d357d292f9b7322a5abeded29d744/3dd58c113f84f253-b3/s640x960/e14a630ddc2ab1fac24c03a5b6e4dd0c6fad343e.png 640w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/a06d357d292f9b7322a5abeded29d744/3dd58c113f84f253-b3/s1280x1920/40e5ec4d8502fe152650b3a281c7840cf3591dcf.png 797w" sizes="(max-width: 797px) 100vw, 797px"/><span class="tmblr-alt-text-helper">ALT</span></figure></div><div class="npf_row"><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="372" data-orig-width="779"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/d952a5012b9a75d7a383909d3e4edb22/3dd58c113f84f253-26/s640x960/54257f1731ae89c93883caf3c1f82cd5e6eb608a.png" data-orig-height="372" data-orig-width="779" alt="But no matter how well the gene therapy works, the researchers recognize that Aissam may never be able to understand or speak a language, Dr. Germiller said.

Hearing can still help patients even if they never learn to speak, he noted. They can hear traffic or know when someone is trying to communicate. The ability to hear also can help with lip reading." srcset="https://64.media.tumblr.com/d952a5012b9a75d7a383909d3e4edb22/3dd58c113f84f253-26/s75x75_c1/8549c92dd6d523f550d3ea7374958adb64718cd7.png 75w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/d952a5012b9a75d7a383909d3e4edb22/3dd58c113f84f253-26/s100x200/7db4ff675aea886c5d06c2d5bc7636fe76691935.png 100w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/d952a5012b9a75d7a383909d3e4edb22/3dd58c113f84f253-26/s250x400/cbec45641ffc602bc3542be605804686cfff7a53.png 250w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/d952a5012b9a75d7a383909d3e4edb22/3dd58c113f84f253-26/s400x600/b506370255157b02dee68e6af1f9e32a06a740bb.png 400w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/d952a5012b9a75d7a383909d3e4edb22/3dd58c113f84f253-26/s500x750/8e70f00522b1774b3c29c094cd3c5a4712b8fd58.png 500w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/d952a5012b9a75d7a383909d3e4edb22/3dd58c113f84f253-26/s540x810/6a8235f17f7661891011e431e6a36cf79cae1f1f.png 540w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/d952a5012b9a75d7a383909d3e4edb22/3dd58c113f84f253-26/s640x960/54257f1731ae89c93883caf3c1f82cd5e6eb608a.png 640w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/d952a5012b9a75d7a383909d3e4edb22/3dd58c113f84f253-26/s1280x1920/a90756ac54fe65d8e477c5aabda07a1c96ce85f4.png 779w" sizes="(max-width: 779px) 100vw, 779px"/><span class="tmblr-alt-text-helper">ALT</span></figure></div><p><b>â€”</b> Kolata, Gina. &ldquo;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2024%2F01%2F23%2Fhealth%2Fdeaf-gene-therapy.html&amp;t=MWFhOGI3ZWM1NGVjYzllN2RhODZkMWIyMDEwYmU0OGE3ZGUxOWQ0YSxmZDY1ZmJjYzY3OTNkZmI4N2E5MTA2OWQ0OWVlMDc1M2ZlNzMwZjI4&amp;ts=1706149843">Gene Therapy Allows an 11-Year-Old Boy to Hear for the First Time</a>.&rdquo; <i>The New York Times</i>, January 23, 2024.

Sure, the doctors gave reasoning about giving child access to environmental sounds, but that is not how ableist society treats deaf individuals who only have aural access to environment.
