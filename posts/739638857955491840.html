The federal government has cut back on CERB (Canada Emergency Response Benefit) and student loans are arriving late. As the result, she is struggling to study.</p><p>I would like to keep her safe from catching COVID at her workplace and at school.</p><p>She will need:</p><ul><li>$5,017 CAD for tuition and student fees</li><li>$2,400 CAD for a laptop</li><li>$800 CAD for books and supplies</li><li>$500 CAD for tutoring</li><li>$200 for community events</li><li>$180 CAD teaching program subscription</li></ul><p>Here is her PayPal: <a href="https://href.li/?https://paypal.me/bglamours">paypal.me/bglamours</a></p><p>Thank you very much!</p></blockquote><p>Think tuition is now covered. Transfer pending.<br/><br/>Still need to come up with six months of rent ($840/month) plus utilities.<br/><br/>Feel free to help her out: <a href="https://paypal.me/bglamours">paypal.me/bglamours</a>.</p></blockquote><p>Still owe the said person about $25 000 (sans inflations) as promised in autumn of 2021.</p><p>Some adjustment for 2024 (estimates only; subject to change):</p><ul><li>$6,077 CAD for tuition and student fees (per year)</li><li>$6,000 CAD living allowance ($200/week)</li><li>$200 CAD for books and supplies</li><li>$500 CAD for tutoring</li><li>$200 CAD for community events</li><li>$140 CAD for membership</li><li>$303.70 CAD bus pass</li></ul><p>Laptop required, but there is no number on how much the laptop should cost.<br/><br/>Rent&rsquo;s not yet calculated. Nor other expenses.</p><p>Feel free to help her out: <a href="https://paypal.me/bglamours">paypal.me/bglamours.</a></p></blockquote><p><b>For transparency:</b> I am still somewhere between $700 (without laptop) to a little over $2 000 CAD (with laptop) short of the autumn 2021 / spring 2022 goals. <br/><br/>Not sure if that counts since the person already has a laptop.<br/><br/>Not counting inflation ($809.14 CAD to $955.40 CAD, adjusted for 2023) or rent, utilities, groceries, transportation and other living costs.<br/><br/>(Also, checked, they did ask for help with rent as well. So, gotta make good on that.)</p></blockquote>
<p>And now bestie is looking for a new job.</p><p>Appreciate anything you can send <a href="https://www.paypal.me/bglamours">via PayPal</a>.<br/><br/>Thank you very much!</p>
