Just realized while fundraising for a laptop for myself several years ago, I had an info-card with payment details and progress bars.</p><p>Totally forgot to do that with the fundraising project to help a friend with college tuition.</p></blockquote><p>Tried to go through the archival websites to retrieve a copy of that card to replicate it.</p><p>The archived posts don&rsquo;t go back that far. Will have to reproduce from memory.<br/><br/>Still feel incompetent for not doing the same thing two - three years ago.</p></blockquote>
<p>Okay, apparently I have about 8 concurrent fundraising campaigns I should retroactively make graphics for and four active ones to maintain.</p>
