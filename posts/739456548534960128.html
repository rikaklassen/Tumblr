<h1>Help bestie with paying for her prescription meds</h1><p>We&rsquo;re expecting rolling blackouts because the conservative governments didn&rsquo;t have the foresight to invest in an anti-fragile grid and anti-fragile infrastructure in preparation for climate change with extremely cold winters and extremely hot summers. Funnily enough, we&rsquo;re being asked to conserve electricity.</p><p>We&rsquo;re experiencing -35°C to -45°C with windchills down to -60°C.</p><p>If the power outages occur, I will not be able to work and <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/rikaklassen/737827616604782592/for-transparency-i-am-still-short-2-000-cad?source=share">help out</a> my friend with her bills. So, we appreciate anything you can contribute to her <a href="https://www.paypal.me/bglamours">PayPal</a>.</p><p>Thank you!</p>
