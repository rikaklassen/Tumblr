                    <p>For some reason, I have no problem trying to fundraise for bestie as a blog post; but reluctant asking the amounts she need in graphics editor (using GIMP, which is similar to Adobe Photoshop). even though I made <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/rikaklassen/738440558716092416/tried-to-go-through-the-archival-websites-to?source=share">a card for myself</a> on Twitter 5 years ago for laptop replacement required at work.</p><p>There is no issue forwarding the paycheques from contract work and the tax returns to her. But having a difficult time asking helping from people on the Internet. Much rather find another gig and provide assistance through my own labour.</p><p>Like in my head, I know I need to keep bestie <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/rikaklassen/738678722460254208/anxious-about-bestie-catching-covid-at-work-wish?source=share">safe from COVID</a>, help her find a better job in a safer workplace and I don&rsquo;t make enough to support her.</p><p>A part of me insists on giving everything I have until there&rsquo;s nothing left before I can ask others to help. But it&rsquo;s not sustainable and burnt out twice before (albeit with different individuals).</p>
