                    <p>Since Substack is back in the news again because of the Twitter algorithm suppression: our content will always be freely available, and <a href="https://href.li/?https://paypal.me/bglamours">tipping</a> is optional.</p><p>Substack&rsquo;s whole business model is to take the blogging ecosystem then paywall them as so-called &ldquo;newsletters&rdquo; under a single centralized platform.</p><p>Substack a trap for writers to barely scrape by under a false promise of being able to sustain a living while corporations receives majority of the profit and take the whole hog.</p><p>If you need to paywall your articles, consider <a href="https://href.li/?https://ghost.org">Ghost</a>. There is not much difference between Ghost and Substack, other than the Substack&rsquo;s success is only due to the path of least resistance.</p><p>Ghost is open-source and can be self-hosted. There are professionals available willing to assist with setting up your own if you have no technical knowledge.</p><p>(There&rsquo;s also <a href="https://href.li/?https://writefreely.org/">WriteFreely</a> / <a href="https://href.li/?https://write.as/writefreely">write.as</a> for the Fediverse with managed hosting options.
