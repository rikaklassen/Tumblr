                    <p>Today I learned Darcy&rsquo;s Wild Life is considered as &ldquo;<a href="https://href.li/?https://lostmediawiki.com/Darcy%27s_Wild_Life_(found_Family_Channel/Discovery_Kids_teen_sitcom;_2004-2006)">lost media</a>&rdquo; because it was never released to home video. And no one recovered the full series until 2022.</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>Bestie was complaining last year none of the streaming platforms have the TV series in their catalogues. Did eventually forward her downloaded copies when YouTube kept copyright-striking fans reuploading the episodes.</p><p>Sister grew up watching that on Family Channel before going to school.<br/><br/>Was seeing if a VHS or DVD exists for bestie&rsquo;s Christmas. But only the soundtrack is available.</p>
