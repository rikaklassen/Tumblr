That person was very important to them.<br/><br/>Except archive.today keeps timing out. Have most of the tweets archived, but about six months worth of dailys are still remaining.</p><p>Hoping to have everything archived before bestie panics. Their birthday is in three days and they don&rsquo;t need this kind of pressure at the moment.</p></blockquote>
<p>All of the tweets are on archive.today.</p><p>Waiting for Internet Archive/Wayback Machine to process my request.</p>
