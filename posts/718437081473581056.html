                    <p>Someone made a suggestion on a wish list and going to have to say this: <br/><br/>I literally not accept anything physical from other people. Cannot drive car due to deafblindness. Everything I own can be shoved into a carry-on and checked luggage for airline travel.<br/><br/>In the past, while living with others, we agreed that whatever excess belongs to the other person. So, whatever gift you give me, you are essentially gifting yourself.<br/><br/>Thank you.</p>
